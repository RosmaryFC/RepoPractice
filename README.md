practicing some commands and flows for Github

Used VIM to open up ReadME on terminal to add this in! VIM is what I've used to fix conflicts in code instead of fixing them in IDE.I am a bit rusty :)


trying to fix an issue with pushing to repo

when I push remotely, terminal keeps asking for my github username and password. I know there is a way to cache it so I will be using this URL as a guide: https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/caching-your-github-password-in-git
